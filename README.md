Here are some guidelines for installing the project on your local machine in order to be able to try it:

Make sure to have mysql server downloaded and running.

Since Node.js applications don't have a front end, clone or download the repository to your own local machine and run it from your command line.

Then, make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running npm init in your command line.

Run node server.js or npm start in your terminal to launch the application.
